Jack's Crap Cricket Scorer
===

This application is intended to replacing the traditional scoring book for grade cricket in NSW, based off my experiences scoring and having a terrible time doing it.

My aim for the program is to enable single clicks to score rather than writing things down three times. The output produced should be similar to the style of the books. The symbols used are the standard symbol set for NSW grade cricket, dot for dot ball, numbers, circles for no balls, plus for wide, up triangle for bye, down triangle for leg bye, W for wicket etc.

I've written it in WPF but the end goal is to refactor this into a multi-ui app also supporting a web app/web server in the same executable.
